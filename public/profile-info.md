# Portfolio Photo

Your professional photo has been added to the portfolio.

To update or replace the photo in the future:

1. Replace the file `profile.jpg` in the `public` folder
2. Keep the filename the same, or update the reference in `app/page.tsx`
3. Recommended: Use a square aspect ratio (e.g., 800x800px) for best results
